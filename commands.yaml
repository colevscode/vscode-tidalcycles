slow:
  cmd: slow times pattern
  help:
    Slow down a pattern. This effectively changes the number of cycles it takes
    for the pattern to repeat.
  params:
    times: The amount to slow down the pattern by. Can be a pattern itself
    pattern: The pattern to slow down
  returns: A slowed down version of the pattern

  examples:
    - 'd1 $ slow 4 $ s "bd!8"'
    - 'd1 $ s "bd!8" # speed (slow 2 $ range 0.95 1.05 square)'
fast:
  cmd: fast times pattern
  help:
    Speed up a pattern. This effectively changes the number of cycles it takes
    for the pattern to repeat.
  params:
    times: The amount to speed up the pattern by. Can be a pattern itself
    pattern: The pattern to speed up
  returns:
    A sped up version of the pattern

stut:
  cmd: stut repeat time decay
  help:
    Similar to a delay, this causes `repeat` versions of the pattern to play
    with an offset of `time` each. Every time the pattern is repeated, the gain
    is multiplied with the `decay` values.
  params:
    repeat: The number of times to repeat the pattern
    time: The delay between the repeated patterns
    decay:
      The amount to multiply the gain by on each repeat. Values `< 1` will
      make the repeats more silent each time, values `> 1` will make their
      volume increase.
  examples:
    - 'd1 $ stut 3 (1/3) 0.8 $ s "sd!4"'
    - 'd1 $ every 2 (stut 3 (1/8) 1.1) $ s "sd!4"'
